# SNES9xVITA
Native SNES emulator for the PlayStation VITA

Currently features Snes9x 1.52 core based on Snes9xNext: https://github.com/libretro/snes9x-next
Will soon feature alongside it the Snes9x 1.43 core based on CATSFC-libretro: https://github.com/libretro/CATSFC-libretro

Depends on:
vita2dlib: https://github.com/xerpi/vita2dlib
vita_portlibs: https://github.com/xerpi/vita_portlibs
psplib4vita: https://github.com/frangarcj/psplib4vita

There are currently a *lot* of missing features, and the emulator does not run at full speed in a lot of games.
